# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the

Find the correct ruby and node version from the Gemfile and .node-version files.
Use a version manager such as `mise` to install and use the correct version

### Running locally

`docker compose up &` starts a database and adminer for you
`rails s` starts the server.
